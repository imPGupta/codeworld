Hi, I am Prashant Kumar Gupta. Currently, I am pursuing my Computer Science and Engineering from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology, Gorakhpur. 
I have a passion for web design and love to create for web and mobile devices.
I am a web developer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps.
Also, I like to work in a team, you will learn faster and much more. As the saying goes: "two heads are better than one".
It is an educational website for learning coding online. It includes tutorials, references, practicals related to C, C++, Java, Data Structure etc.
